These are atomic orbitals from exchange-only LDA calculations using
five 15-node radial elements with HelFEM with full spherical
averaging, which should give a good starting point for calculations in
x2dhf.

The format used for the data is

(number of radial points) (number of orbitals)
[ angular momenta of the orbitals ]
[ orbital occupation numbers ]
[ orbital energies ]
[[ radius1 orbital11 orbital12 orbital13 ... orbital1N ]]
